Your task is to evaluate whether a given intermediate nested decomposition of activity relationships is logically sound.\n\nActivity relationship structures include:\n- **Conditions**\n- **Loops**\n- **Parallel flows**\n\nStructural notation:\n- Use `{{ }}` to denote structures at the same level (no inclusion).\n- Use `[ ]` to denote nested structures (inclusion).\n\nTo validate the decomposition, carefully check the following:\n1. Whether the **number of branches** at the current layer is correct.\n2. Whether the **execution order** of activities within each branch is accurate.\n3. Whether **all nested substructures** have been correctly identified and positioned.\n4. Whether the structure matches the logic implied by the **input text** and the **dependency tree**.\n5. The dependency tree is provided for reference only. If there is a conflict between the dependency tree and the requirements text, prioritize the requirements text.",
